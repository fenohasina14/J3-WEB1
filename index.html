                <p>The guitar's history is a captivating narrative spanning centuries and cultures, marked by creativity
                    and innovation. Originating in medieval Europe, it drew inspiration from ancient plucked string
                    instruments. Craftsmen in 14th century Spain laid the groundwork for the modern guitar. The
                    classical guitar flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries, notably with Antonio de Torres Jurado's
                    innovations. Across time, the guitar has evolved through cultural exchanges, shaping diverse styles
                    like flamenco and bossa nova. Today, it remains a global fascination, resonating in blues clubs,
                    concert halls, and parties worldwide, uniting people through the enchantment of music.</p>

                <p> The classical guitar, also known as the Spanish guitar, reigns as the favorite among guitar
                    aficionados. Its hollow body, featuring an opening, enriches resonance when strummed or plucked.
                    Sporting six nylon strings, it offers a softer touch, making playing a breeze. Traditionally played
                    with fingers, it doesn't need amplification, although sound systems can enhance its sound. Classical
                    guitars shine in classical, Latin, and flamenco music, embodying timeless charm and adaptability.

            <div class="accoustique">
                <p> The acoustic guitar bears resemblance to the classical guitar in shape and appearance and typically
                    doesn't require amplification. However, it differs in its use of steel strings, producing a more
                    robust sound. Constructed with heavier woods like spruce, maple, and mahogany, it can withstand the
                    tension of steel strings. Primarily utilized in folk, blues, country, and rock genres, the acoustic
                    guitar offers versatility across various musical styles.</p>

                <p> The bass guitar, with its deep tones and pivotal role in rhythm and harmony, is a vital element in
                    various music genres. Featuring four strings and a longer neck than standard guitars, it produces
                    lower pitches, providing the backbone for rock, jazz, funk, and more. Bassists use techniques like
                    fingerstyle or slap bass to create distinctive grooves, driving songs forward with commanding
                    presence and dynamic energy.</p>

            <div class="electrique">
                <p>The electric guitar, a modern musical wonder, relies on electronic amplification for sound. With a
                    solid body and pickups, it converts string vibrations into electrical signals, amplified for volume
                    and tone control. Renowned for versatility, electric guitars span genres like rock, blues, and jazz,
                    offering clean to distorted tones. They've shaped music history, empowering innovation and
                    captivating global audiences with electrifying presence.</p>
