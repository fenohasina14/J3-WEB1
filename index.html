                <p>The guitar's history is a captivating narrative spanning centuries and cultures, marked by creativity
                    and innovation. Originating in medieval Europe, it drew inspiration from ancient plucked string
                    instruments. Craftsmen in 14th century Spain laid the groundwork for the modern guitar. The
                    classical guitar flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries, notably with Antonio de Torres Jurado's
                    innovations. Across time, the guitar has evolved through cultural exchanges, shaping diverse styles
                    like flamenco and bossa nova. Today, it remains a global fascination, resonating in blues clubs,
                    concert halls, and parties worldwide, uniting people through the enchantment of music.</p>

            <div class="classique">
                <img src="Image/téléchargement (1).jpg" alt="">
                <p> The classical guitar, also known as the Spanish guitar, is the most popular among the three types of
                    guitars. It features a hollow body with an opening that enhances resonance when strummed or plucked.
                    Typically equipped with six nylon strings, it offers a softer touch compared to steel strings,
                    making it easier to play. Traditionally, it is played with fingers rather than a pick and does not
                    require amplification, though amplifiers or sound systems can be used. Classical guitars find
                    prominence in classical, Latin, and flamenco music genres.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accoustique">
                <p> The acoustic guitar bears resemblance to the classical guitar in shape and appearance and typically
                    doesn't require amplification. However, it differs in its use of steel strings, producing a more
                    robust sound. Constructed with heavier woods like spruce, maple, and mahogany, it can withstand the
                    tension of steel strings. Primarily utilized in folk, blues, country, and rock genres, the acoustic
                    guitar offers versatility across various musical styles.</p>

                <img src="Image/OIP (1).jpg" alt="">
                <p> The bass guitar is a vital element across various music genres, renowned for its deep, resonant
                    tones and pivotal role in establishing rhythm and harmony. Typically equipped with four strings and
                    a longer neck than a standard guitar, it enables lower pitches. Found in rock, jazz, funk, and more,
                    bass guitars lay the groundwork for other instruments. Bassists employ techniques like fingerstyle
                    or slap bass to craft distinctive grooves and rhythms. With its commanding presence, the bass guitar
                    drives the momentum of songs, contributing to memorable and dynamic musical compositions.</p>

            <div class="electrique">
                <p>The electric guitar, a modern musical marvel, relies on electronic amplification for sound
                    production. Featuring a solid body and pickups, it converts string vibrations into electrical
                    signals, which are then amplified for volume and tone control. Renowned for its versatility,
                    electric guitars span genres like rock, blues, and jazz, offering a wide sonic range from clean to
                    distorted tones. These instruments have left an indelible mark on music history, empowering
                    musicians to experiment and innovate while captivating audiences worldwide with their electrifying
                    presence.</p>

                <p>The folk guitar, deeply ingrained in diverse cultures and musical traditions, is celebrated for its
                    versatility. Featuring a hollow body and steel strings, it produces rich, resonant tones. Accessible
                    to beginners yet appealing to seasoned musicians for its expressive capabilities, the folk guitar
                    accompanies various genres including blues, country, and traditional folk music. Whether used for
                    rhythmic strumming or intricate fingerpicking, folk guitars bring people together from campfires to
                    concert halls, speaking a universal language of melody and harmony.</p>
